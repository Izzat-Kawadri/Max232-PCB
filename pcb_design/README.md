## Overview
This folder contains the PCB design files for the MAX232 PCB project. The design translates the schematic into a physical board layout, ensuring that all components are placed correctly and connected via copper traces. The PCB is designed using Eagle PCB design software.

## Files in This Folder
- **max232_pcb.brd**: The Eagle PCB board file, containing the full PCB layout for the MAX232 circuit.
- **max232_pcb.png**: A high-resolution image of the PCB design for quick reference.

  > **Note:** The `.brd` file can be opened with Eagle PCB design software or any compatible tool that supports Eagle file formats.

## PCB Layout Overview
The PCB design includes:
- **Component Placement**: All components, such as the MAX232 IC, capacitors, resistors, DB9 connector, and LEDs, are placed optimally for easy assembly and signal integrity.
- **Routing**: Copper traces connect the components according to the schematic. The design is optimized for signal clarity and minimal interference.
- **Power and Ground Planes**: The PCB includes ground and power planes for better noise management and stability.
- **Single-Layer Design**: This PCB is designed as a single-layer board, making it simple to manufacture and cost-effective.

## PCB Design Process
The design was created by following these steps:
1. **Schematic to PCB Conversion**: The schematic from the [schematic folder](../schematics) was converted to a PCB design using Eagle’s board editor.
2. **Component Placement**: Components were arranged to ensure logical signal flow and compact layout.
3. **Routing**: Signal traces were routed between components while minimizing trace length and avoiding cross-talk.
4. **Design Rule Check (DRC)**: A DRC was performed to ensure that all traces and clearances meet manufacturing standards.
