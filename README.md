## Introduction
This repository contains the design files, schematic, and implementation details for a printed circuit board (PCB) that utilizes the MAX232 IC. The project is created using the Eagle PCB design software. The MAX232 is commonly used for RS-232 serial communication, and this project demonstrates how to design and implement a PCB for it.

## What is MAX232?
The MAX232 is an integrated circuit (IC) used to convert signals from a TIA-232 (RS-232) serial port to signals suitable for use in TTL-compatible digital logic circuits. It is a dual driver/receiver and typically requires a single 5V power supply. The IC includes capacitive voltage generators to supply the necessary voltage levels for RS-232 communication, making it a popular choice in embedded systems that need serial communication.

### Key Features:
- Dual transmitter/receiver pairs
- Operates from a single 5V power supply
- Converts RS-232 signals to TTL levels
- Requires external capacitors for voltage generation
